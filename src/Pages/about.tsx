                            I have a background in Computer Science, and during my undergrad program I experienced designing and developing
                            a lot of digital experiences. While interning with<span className="font-semibold"> Accenture </span>is when I got introduced to <span className="font-semibold">production scale product 
                            design and development</span>. Further my experience at <span className="font-semibold">Ingram Micro</span> made me <span className="font-semibold">realise the importance of User Experience design </span> 
                             and fascinated me to study user behaviour and visualize solutions. Since then I've been working as an <span className="font-semibold"> User Experience designer and 
                            a fullstack web developer</span> with an aim for creating amazing experiences.
