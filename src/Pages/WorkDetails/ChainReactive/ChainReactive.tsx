                Chain Reactive LLC is a Pennsylvania-based startup in the food and beverage industry. 
                They have a POS system and wanted to develop an online ordering platform that would integrate with the POS. 
                That's where I came into the picture. My aim was to create a responsive website that would provide a 
                comprehensive experience for users looking to order online from local businesses. 
                I did this by constantly being in touch with the stakeholders and involving them in the design process.

                  While developing the product and working with stakeholders, I came across the business and customers need to be able to schedule an order for later.
                    I conducted several interviews with businesses and customers to understand the main issues.
                    Most of the businesses that we spoke to were restaurants. From the business owner's interviews, I concluded the following-

                    <ul className="p-5 mt-5 list-disc">
                      <li >
                        The business owners wanted the customers to schedule the order at a specific time so that they could plan their resources accordingly.
                      </li>
                      <li >
                      The menu items or the pricing of items could differ depending upon the requested delivery time.
                      </li>
                      <li >
                      Traditionally, they took orders over the phone so they didnâ€™t face this issue as they could inform the consumer about any changes immediately.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  </p>

                  <p className="mt-5 sm:w-2/3">
                    From customers interviews, I concluded that -
                    <ul className="list-disc p-5">
                      <li >
                        They wanted the ability to order in advance for special occasions like parties.
                      </li>
                      <li >
                        They wanted the ability to plan their meals for the week and hence needed this feature of being able to schedule the order.
                      </li>

                  From this, we concluded that the businesses required the consumers to select a pick up time explicitly. <br></br><br></br>
                  This feature was rather crucial as it would affect the menu and prices of the items. It turned out to be more important than we thought.

                    These led to the User Story -

                    Our initial design included a day picker followed by a shift (Breakfast,Lunch,Dinner) picker and then a time picker.
                    Once the user made a time selection the menu section of the webpage would be populated. The business owners liked this design of the user having to explicitly select the timing.

                Although this design satisfied the needs of the business owners, I felt it was not user-friendly from the customer's perspective.
                  So I decided to create a simple google form and survey the customers to understand their perspectives. They were also asked their opinion
                  on this design. Some of the questions were as follows-
                  <br></br> <br></br>
                  <ul className="p-5 list-disc">
                    <li>
                    Would you be comfortable selecting a pickup/delivery time every time you wanted to order something?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    How many times do you pre-order items for a future time?
                    </li>

                  </ul>
                  <br></br>
                  43 people answered this survey.
                </p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div className="my-20">
              <div className="w-full">
                <p className={headingStyle}>

                </p>
                <div className={textStyle}>
                  <p>
                  To no surprise, the results of the survey were as follows-

                    <br></br>
                    <img className="object-contain" src = {surveyImage} alt="SurveyImage" />
                    
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <span>
                    From this, it was pretty clear that even though the feature was an important one from the perspective of the business owners, it was just a good to have feature from the perspective of the consumers as the consumers mostly placed orders for asap delivery/pickup.
                    </span>
                    <br></br>
                    This discovery led to new and better prototypes.

                  I then came up with this design prototype where ASAP delivery was selected by default, and only if the user wanted to order for a future time, he had to make a change to it. The time picker and shift picker (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) were hidden when ASAP was selected and only showed up when Today or Later was selected.
                  <br>
                  </br>
                  <br></br>
                  However, this prototype was rejected during testing by the consumers. From their feedback, I concluded that - 
                   <ul className="list-disc p-5">
                     <li>
                     They felt that the time picker section that appeared once the user clicked on "Today" or "Later" was overwhelming when it appeared on the screen. It needed to be moved to a separate component.

                     </li>
                     <li>Users wanted the ability to shift between the different shifts of the current day easily.</li>
                     </ul> 
                     
                  </p>
                  <img className="w-full sm:w-1/2 object-contain" src={UpdatedPrototype} alt="UpdatedPrototyping" />
                  </div>
                  <br></br>
                  <p>
                  This led to a new prototype.
                  </p>
                </div>
               
              </div>
            </div>

            <div className="my-20">
              <div className="w-full">
                <p className={headingStyle}>
                  {"Final Prototyping"}
                </p>
                <div className={textStyle}>
                  <div className="flex sm:flex-row flex-col">
                  <img className="w-full sm:w-1/2 object-contain" src={FinalPrototype} alt="UpdatedPrototyping" />
                  <p className="sm:w-1/2">
                  The following design iteration was a simple dropdown that displayed the current day's available shifts. By default, the current shift or the next available shift was selected, and the menu was populated according to this. 
                  <br>
                  </br>
                  <br></br>
                  The dropdown also had a schedule option. A popup would appear on clicking the schedule option, where the user could make further selections.
                  <br>
                  </br>
                  <br></br>
                  This prototype was accepted by both the customers and business owners, and I decided to implement it. 
                     
                  </p>

                  We were able to come up with a design that satisfied the needs of the business owners while also keeping the complexity to a minimum for the consumers. 

                  <br>
                  </br>
                  <br></br>
                  <ul className="list-disc p-5">
                  <li>
                  The end design was a very simple dropdown which didnâ€™t clutter the screen unnecessarily. This worked from the user's perspective. 

                  </li>
                  <li>
                  The business owner's requirement of having the user select the pickup/delivery time was addressed by making a default selection which would be handled by code. 
                  </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br></br>

                  During this process, I learnt that itâ€™s essential to consider the requirements of all 
                  your user groups and develop a design that works for them. 
                  Each user group might have different roles and perform various actions. 
                  The business owners are our customers, 
                  who are going to pay us, but it was vital for us to focus on their 
                  customers as well, as thatâ€™s how they will be making money from them.
                  <br></br><br></br>
                  The product is still in its development phase, and all these learnings are helping us improve the user experience for other features we are working on.
